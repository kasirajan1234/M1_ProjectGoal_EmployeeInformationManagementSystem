# INTRODUCTION
  The "Employee Record System Project in C" mini-project is a console programme written in the C programming language. The GCC compiler was used to compile this project in Code Blocks. You can use this console programme to perform basic Employee Record functions such as adding employee information, viewing newly added employees, and searching for employees. This programme is based on file handling in C, and it uses file-related functions such as fopen, fread, fwrite, and so on. The good news is that "Employee Record System Project" is password-protected, allowing only authorised users to access it. I've also divided the programme into distinct functions to make it easier to read. Each project function heavily relies on the file handling function, making it an excellent project for learning C file handling.
# OBJECTIVE
  In this world of growing technologies everything has been computerized. With large number of 
  work opportunities the Human workforce has increased. Thus there is a need of a system which 
  can handle the data of such a large number of Employees in an organization. This project 
  simplifies the task of maintain records because of its user friendly nature.
# SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS
  A successful system must: -
1. Satisfy the user requirements
2. Be easy to understand by user and operator
3. Be easy to operate
4. Have a good user interface
5. Be easy to modify
6. Be expandable
7. Have adequate security control against the misuse of data
8. Handle the errors and exceptions satisfactorily
9. Be delivered on schedule within the budget

# SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION
  The aim of the system is to develope “EMPLOYEE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM” software, 
which should automate the process to create and store employee details . The system is supposed 
to be used as a subsystem in a large office system, which could be manual system or a 
computerized one. Therefore, the proposed system must be able to function under both 
circumstances.
The proposed system is not a freeware and due to the usage of swings, becomes user 
interactive.
 1. The project demand a page of employee details that include:
 2. Employees personel detail.
 3. Employees salary, allowances, deductions.
# HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
  Minimum - 32 MB
Recommended- - 64 MB
 1. HDD - To install the software at least 2 GB and the data storage is 
    depending upon the organizational setup.
 2. PROCESSOR - Intel Pentium IV, 1GHZ or above
 3. RAM - 256MB or above
 4. VIDEO - 1024x768, 24-bit colors
 5. KEYBOARD - Standard 104 Keys(QWERTY)
 6. OPERATING SYSTEM - WindowsXP Professional
 7. DEVELOPING LANGUAGE - JAVA(jdk-5)
 8. DATABASE - MICROSOFT SQL SERVER 2005
# CONCLUSION
  Since this project has been designed exclusively as a project, certain complexities that do faced by any real life manual problem like total no. of employee, address redundancy etc. are considered in this project. But enhancement to the project can easily be made without changing the current design and programming structure.
